# KGCV_Strawberry
A knowledge-guided computer vision framework for strawberry fruit detection and growth modeling. 

For detailed methodology please refer to "Qi Yang, Licheng Liu, Junxiong Zhou, Mary Rogers, Zhenong Jin, 2024.

## Train detection network
"KGCV_Strawberry_Train_FasterRCNN.py" is used to train a faster-RCNN for strawberry bounding box and main phenological stage detection
## Train trait estimation network
"KGCV_Strawberry_Train_CNN.py" is for traing a CNN to estimate the fruit size and decimal phenological stage. 
## Train parameter network
We employ the S-shape function to represent the fruit growth progress, with its curve parameters serving as the fruit growth parameters.
$$f(x) = \frac{y_0 - s}{1 + e^{-r(x-t_0)}} + s$$
where $y_0$, $s$, and $r$ are three curve parameters control the trajectory of fruit size.
"KGCV_Strawberry_Train_MLP-1_parameterNet.py" builds the mapping from a sparse 1Ã—70 diameter/length sequence to these three curve parameters.
To establish this mapping, this script use the "loadSyntheticData" function to generate the synthetic data
```
# load dataset    
syn = loadSyntheticData(mode=mode,ensembleN=1000)
```
Then this generated synthetic dataset was used to train the parameter network.
## Train fruit growth netwrk
"KGCV_Strawberry_Train_MLP-1_growthNet.py" trains a MLP to map fruit size at $t$ to $t+\Delta t$
$$s_{t+\Delta t} = g(s_t, \Delta GDD, Para)$$
